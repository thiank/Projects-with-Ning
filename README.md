# Projects-with-Ning
random stats and machine learning stuff
**Disclaimers: Ning's code but inspired by Ian's dataset and written by Ian so there's a lot of profanity. Ning does not claim any responsibility for all the cursing. I don't either but whatever. The below does not reflect any views by the authors, despite the correct assumption that they wrote it.**\n",

"# Today's topic: T-tests vs. Permutation Tests\n",
"\n",
"<br />So. Which one is better?\n",
"<br />Who knows, so let the BATTLE FUCKING ROYALE begin.\n",
"<br />Or more correctly put - which test provides a better characterization of the data? How do we show what these datasets tell us better?\n",
"\n",
"What we did here:\n",
"<br />Say we have two datasets that are borderline different / significant at p = 0.05.\n",
"<br />Our question is - are these datasets significantly different really/like srsly/IRL?\n",
"<br />So we're going to simulate an extreme case with small sample sizes. \n",
"\n",
"**First**, we do a t-test. Well, we simulate a t-test:\n",
"<br />We have a dataset A that has a mean of 1.24 and a standard deviation of 1.75, with a N = 10.\n",
"<br />Then we have another dataset B that has a mean of 1.78 and a standard deviation of 1.1, with a N = 15.\n",
"\n",
"p.s. SPSS sucks. Obv. SPSS can't do this shit, because it don't do different Ns. Filthy casuals. #python-FTW\n",
"\n",
"When doing t-tests, we have to assume:\n",
"\n",
"1. independent sampling (every single subject is randomly sampled, aka, subject 1 and subject 2 and subject 3 are independently sampled. but they're not a lot of the times. but we can't do anything about dis. wtf, aka in psychology terms, wutever.)\n",
"\n",
"2. normalization, aka normal distribution (personal note: I don't think any of the shit we test is normal a lot of the times, but let's thank Fisher's gargantuan legacy and the lazy-as-fuck posterity children that we are for just going with the flow)\n",
"\n",
"3. equal variance (we can assume both cases: equal and non-equal variance, so we will below (because we be thorough))\n",
"\n",
"/beginrant\n",
"<br />So what this means is that, in using t-tests, we generally and literally violate every single assumption in any fucking psych/neuro/#FAKE-scientific study we do. \n",
"<br />So why do we use t-tests?\n",
"<br />Because there are no better alternatives. p.s. but it don't have to be. We are the purveyors of dis light, the deus ex machina of your statistical nonchalance.\n",
